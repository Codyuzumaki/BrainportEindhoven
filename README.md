# Brainport Eindhoven Tech Xperience 2020
This repo contains a solution to clasify some Philips products among 4 clases.

Since the model file is too heavy to store it in GitHub, there are 2 options to get the solution:

**OPTION 1:** Download the zip with the whole solution from this google drive link and unzip it:

  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NaJoQHsw2a-gkWiNYHh1kXpf1vjxX_CC

**OPTION 2:** Download the BrainportEindhovenVictorRamosWithoutModel.zip file from this repo and unzip it.
Then, download the Model file from the following google drive link, uncompress it and place the file *Philips_model_v.3.7.h5* into the folder where you unzipped the *BrainportEindhovenVictorRamosWithoutModel.zip* file:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=15ATooVcqTzuEnn_KdHjK8h8G7Hv1gh2Y

To unzip the files, you must use the password that was provided to you. If you don't have the password or you've forgotten it, please request it to me by mail: **victorramos7@gmail.com**

The images to be classified must be placed in the "New_Images" folder. Note that there are already 4 images in the folder in case it is necessary to test the system without new images. You can remove them before starting a new test.

The images can be of any size, buy the algorithm was optimized to work with 4032x3024 images.

Docker must be installed in the local computer to run the algorythm. To install Docker, go to **www.docker.com**.

Once Docker is installed and running, you should run the Run_Analyzer.bat. A command window will appear and the configuration of the environment will start. Immediately after the configuration ends, the classificator will automatically start to analyze every image in the New_Images folder and will give a result for each one with a single execution.

As an alternative to this .bat file, you can run these below commands in a command window in the path where the files are located (Notice the last dot in the first command) to build and run the solution:


**docker build -t philipssolution .**

**docker run philipssolution**


For any doubt, you can contact me through my e-mail below.
