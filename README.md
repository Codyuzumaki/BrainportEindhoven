This repo contains a solution to clasify some Philips products among 4 clases.

To run the algorythm, these files and folder should be in the same folder:
-DockerFile
-Philips_model_v.3.7.h5
-Philips_Product_Analyzer.py
-New_Images (folder)

The images to be classified must be placed in the "New_Images" folder.

Docker must be installed in the local computer to run the algorythm.

Once Docker was installed, this commands should be executed in a command window in the path where the files are located (Notice the last dot in the first command) to build and run the solution:

**docker build -t PhilipsSolution .

**docker run PhilipsSolution**

The command window will show the results of the analysis.
